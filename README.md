# employee-checklist
This code defines two classes: Date and Employee. The Date class represents dates and includes functions to validate day values, considering leap years. The Employee class uses Date objects to store an employee's birth date and hire date.The constructors in both classes print details upon creation, while destructors print details upon destruction. This approach is common in applications managing employee information, ensuring accurate validation and formatting of dates. Many factories and workplaces uses this method to securely store their employees personal data.
